""Either write something worth reading or do something worth writing."" - Benjamin Franklin

The best way to learn any concept, especially in data science, is by writing about it. That not only helps you understand what you learned in more detail, but sharing it with the community helps others understand how a particular data science idea works.

But here’s the thing - most people want to write, but just can’t get past the initial challenges. This might sound familiar to a lot of people:

    What should I write about?
    Will anyone read my article?
    How do I make my article stand out?
    Should I even write?
